DMGAjp3MZg2,"The Epstein story won’t bring down MAGA — but the cracks it’s revealing in Trump’s base just might.
While MAGA influencers chase conspiracies, voters are turning on Trump over tariffs, immigration crackdowns, and brutal budget cuts.
2026 could be a GOP disaster

DMEZkz5vY1Q,"To my family and friends in MICHIGAN, I told you so. I told you Trump will be a major disaster, and he is. You may not have voted for this, but you should’ve been smarter. And it’s going to hurt you and your neighbors. I’m not happy for anyone who is suffering. It’s a hard lesson to learn. I hope you learn. Trump is every bit a disaster we warned you he would be. Good luck."
DMGCopdg5bP,Groups of first responders from Mexico immediately came to Texas to help with flood relief after the catastrophic disaster.
DMGFAoQsWXK,Reckless and dangerous. This administration is doubling down on their plans to slash funding for disaster response. They're even considering eliminating FEMA altogether. I refuse to stand idly by while Georgia lives and livelihoods are at risk.
DMGFRIKR2h2,"I consider myself pretty level headed, calm, and patient. It's been almost 2 months since my initial home owners claim. The lack of communication from the agent handling my case is absolutely unacceptable. Every contact that has been made has been due to ME calling. Nothing has been approved. My kitchen and living area are disaster zones. My voicemails go unreturned. I've now emailed the agent where my policy resides and she's reaching out to the claims manager."
DMFpfIwIiNm,Across various private New York Facebook groups viewed by CNN – such as those for residents of the Upper East Side – some users have anonymously discussed potential plans to move out of the city following Zohran Mamdani’s primary win. cnn.it/4lLhw… cnn.it/4lLhw…
DMF1o_ZoyQE,"If you want to see the economic disaster that electing radical socialists can lead to, just look at Venezuela."
DMGEcQSOUsP,"Bhai the new superman felt like a complete disaster , it's such a disappointment. How did they end up from a darker version of masterpiece DC out of comic series to a live action of comic stories which actually shows that comic page costumes feels like clowns in real adaptations. BTW Batman will always be the central point of attraction for DC. Hope they don't make him a Halloween costumer."
DMEaAi3g-Sd,"Texas is experiencing natural disaster after natural disaster. 129 dead. Over 160 still missing. Rescues just got halted—again—because more floods are hitting. And Trump? At a soccer game. This country’s broken when leaders show up for cameras, not crises."
DMFysbTM3BZ,"Not pointing fingers because I don't have enough fingers, but the fact that Kerr County Texas had the chance to upgrade their critical infrastructure but voted against it because the money came from Joe Biden is all I need to hear to prove that MAGA continues to kill their own."
DMGG7Zxuybh,"Annnnd that (along with them wanting to arrest/deport the Mexican rescue teams) is why I have zero empathy or sympathy for any of them or their missing/dead families. This is the first disaster since the Temu Nazis took over that I'm like ""too bad so sad"". I can usually understand that there are some blue dots in places... but after listening to the actual audio of them saying they didn't want the $, then getting the $, and STILL not upgrading the system?? Fuck em."
