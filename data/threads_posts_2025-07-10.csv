DL7YLIkJO5G,"North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein on Trump wanting the states and not FEMA to handle disaster response: ""We don't get a huge storm every year. The country does. It doesn't make sense for each state to have a fully staffed emergency response team."""
DL7zmYcM-rh,"As DHS secretary, Kristi Noem bears ultimate responsibility for FEMA policies. Changing approval protocols that delay response during a disaster should raise serious concerns about her leadership and we must hold her accountable."
DL6x77vOiB4,"Vulnerable post warning. Usually my dating disaster stories are funny but this one gutted me. *Please be kind in the comments, I'm fragile.* I let myself get excited and hopeful. Full lover girl soft mode activated. The connection was genuine and being together felt so comfortable and safe. I share this to show the perspective of the ghosted. It is so easy to just disappear from someone's life nowadays with no repercussions. The person getting ghosted doesn't have that luxury though. ðŸ‘»"
DL7hCKLs_da,"Dear Greg Abbott:
While Texans are literally drowning, youâ€™re holding a special session to drown democracy. People are missing. Homes are underwater. Communities are wrecked. And your top priority? Redrawing maps so your party can keep power even if voters want you gone. Itâ€™s not leadership. Itâ€™s not compassion.
Itâ€™s gerrymandering during a natural disaster. If thereâ€™s one thing more flooded than Texas right now... itâ€™s your moral compass."
DL7lvYtM9w5,If Charlie Kirk can blame DEI on the death toll in Texas I think itâ€™s fair we can blame the cuts to the National Weather Service and FEMA has had on disaster relief
DL7yf0cMo-A,"This isnâ€™t just a flight. Itâ€™s a lifeline. A Wings of Rescue plane today at San Angelo Regional Airport ... Good samaritans loading pets from shelters affected the devastating floodings in Central Texas.
The plane will also make a stopover in San Marcos to pick up even more dogs and cats whoâ€™ve been waiting for a chance to get out of the disaster zone. You can help and donate to keep the planes flying > wingsofrescue.org/donatâ€¦ wingsofrescue.org/donatâ€¦ ðŸ“½ Wings of Rescue"
DL7x-esOkOh,"Kristi Noem literally went on the Sunday talk shows and blamed Biden for the disaster in Texas, BEFORE SHE SENT THE FEMA SEARCH AND RESCUE!!! I'm not the person politicizing this. I'm the one telling you that Republican politicians are killing you with politics."
DL5MdSPsR3F,"We need the National Weather Service before disaster strikes.
We need FEMA for when it does. And we need a president who gets that this is obvious."
